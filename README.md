This project is to apply the probability theories learned through CS5002 to predict the flight status at SEA (Seattle Tacoma Int'l Airport).

Two data files were combined into a single dataset, which included 174,009 departure flight records from 2022. The merged dataset contained details about flight schedules, delays, airlines, and weather-related information, such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, which are crucial to our analysis.

We put our knowledge of probability to work, concentrating on Naive Bayesian Model and Logistic Regression methods, and applied them to our collected dataset. After splitting the data into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%), we trained our prediction models and evaluated their accuracy. Throughout this process, we used Python software to bring our application to life.
